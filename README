UAE Native Interface SDK
========================

This SDK contains header files to use when compiling native libraries for
UAE.

Examples are found in the examples directory. To run one specific example:

  cd examples/hello-world
  make run

The makefiles (uni.mk, examples/examples.mk) are currently set up to
compile with m68k-amigaos-gcc cross-compiler, and g++ for Linux x86-64.
The examples are run with FS-UAE which must be found alongside the
uni-sdk folder (or modify the .mk files).
